Hi, I am Yuwei! I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCLA, advised by [Prof. Eunice Jun](https://eunicemjun.com) in the [Computation and Discovery Lab](https://ucla-cdl.org); I also work closely with [Prof. Antti Oulasvirta](https://users.aalto.fi/~oulasvir/) at Aalto University.

My research explores how interactive systems can help people understand and make sense of complex data and models, empowering them to combine, manage, and extend their knowledge with powerful computational tools. 
I design and build interactive visualization interfaces that make abstract or opaque concepts more tangible, supporting better reasoning, communication, and decision-making.

Broadly, my interests lie at the intersection of **human–computer interaction**, **data visualization**, **human–AI collaboration**, and **sense-making**. I’m particularly passionate about visual thinking—how visualization can spark insight, creativity, and shared understanding between people and intelligent systems.

Previously, I was fortunated to work with [Prof. Haojian Jin](https://www.haojianj.in) in the at UCSD. I earned my bachelor degree from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/).
