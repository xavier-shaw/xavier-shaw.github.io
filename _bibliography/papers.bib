  title={PriorWeaver: Prior Elicitation via Iterative Dataset Construction}, 
  author={Yuwei Xiao and Shuai Ma and Antti Oulasvirta and Eunice Jun},
  venue={Preprint (Under Review)},
  year={2025},
  abstract={In Bayesian analysis, prior elicitation, or the process of explicating one's beliefs to inform statistical modeling, is an essential yet challenging step. Analysts often have beliefs about real-world variables and their relationships. However, existing tools require analysts to translate these beliefs and express them indirectly as probability distributions over model parameters. We present PriorWeaver, an interactive visualization system that facilitates prior elicitation through iterative dataset construction and refinement. Analysts
visually express their assumptions about individual variables and their relationships. Under the hood, these assumptions create a dataset used to derive statistical priors. Prior predictive checks then help analysts compare the priors to their assumptions. In a lab
study with 17 participants new to Bayesian analysis, we compare PriorWeaver to a baseline incorporating existing techniques. Compared to the baseline, PriorWeaver gave participants greater control, clarity, and confidence, leading to priors that were better
aligned with their expectations},

  title={On the Feasibility of Reasoning about the Internal States of Blackbox IoT Devices Using Side-Channel Information},
  author={Wei Sun* and Yuwei Xiao* and Haojian Jin and Dinesh Bharadia},
  venue={Preprint},
  year={2023},
  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) devices are typically designed to function in a secure, closed environment, making it difficult for users to comprehend devices' behaviors. This paper shows that a user can leverage side-channel information to reason fine-grained internal states of black box IoT devices. The key enablers for our design are a multi-model sensing technique that fuses power consumption, network traffic, and radio emanations and an annotation interface that helps users form mental models of a black box IoT system. We built a prototype of our design and evaluated the prototype with open-source IoT devices and black-box commercial devices. Our experiments show a false positive rate of 1.44% for open-source IoT devices' state probing, and our participants take an average of 19.8 minutes to reason the internal states of black-box IoT devices.},
